# mozoomdar at sea
This is the digital humanities exhibit of my research on Protap Chunder Mozoomdar's travel from Kolkata to Chicago in 1893.

As of now, the journey text is provisionally finished.

Archival resources will be added as they become available to me.

Forgive the formatting on the Map page, and the broken links in the Archives section.
