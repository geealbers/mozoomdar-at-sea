The Cunard RMS Umbria mesmerized Mozoomdar, who appears to have
forgotten much of his anxiety during his week on the Atlantic. He wrote
for *The Interpreter* that the ship was not so much a floating palace as
a floating city, accommodating over 1000 passengers and personnel.

He spent his time amid sumptuous food, lavish salons, and galleries,
complaining only that his quarters were "dark, stuffy, and
overcrowded."[^47] Yet PCM had cause enough to occupy himself elsewhere.
In the same article, he marvels at a close encounter with an iceberg
seen off the starboard side, describing in detail how its proximity both
figuratively and literally chilled those on deck.[^48] Perhaps the
clearest evidence of his merriment is that Mozoomdar wrote only one
brief note to Saudamini while on the ship. He reported good health,
feeling refreshed by the sea air and free from seasickness, and
mentioned a much warmer reception by these shipmates than he felt aboard
the SS Khedive.[^49] Mozoomdar gave two lectures in the RMS Umbria's
galleries, each attracting hundreds of listeners who applauded him to
the point of embarrassment.[^50] On 2 September, Mozoomdar greeted the
shores of New York.
