Mozoomdar indeed felt that God was near. As he traveled the Bay of
Biscay, which he thought would be ridden with storms, he attributed his
calm passage to "the grace of the Almighty."[^35]Â Yet God's proximity
stood in contrast to the ever-increasing distance separating Mozoomdar
from his friends and family. Over a month had elapsed since his
departure, and a letter to Saudamini shows that these loved ones often
came to mind. A chair given to PCM by his friend Dr. Dutta in Kolkata is
the object of much attention by the sailors, who fitted a small pillow
to its headrest. Mozoomdar expresses gratitude for the chair, which
helped him to sleep on nights when the stuffiness of his former cabin
kept him awake. His recently improved health serves as an occasion to
hope for the wellbeing of his distant compatriots, whom he asks
Saudamini to send his love. Even the luxurious lifestyle of the
passengers reminds him of home, for it so starkly differs from the
poverty he and his wife suffered in their early marriage.[^36] In sum,
Mozoomdar's anticipation of London was outpaced by nostalgia for home.

[^36]: Mozoomdar's lack of means stemmed from his decision to work,
    without compensation, for a Brahmo Samaj newspaper and his
    estrangement from family, which resulted in the partial loss of his
    inheritance. See Bose, *The Life of Protap*, 22-30.
