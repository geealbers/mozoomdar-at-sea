Protap Chunder Mozoomdar gave a farewell address to his Brahmo Samaj
congregation on Sunday evening, July 9, 1893.[^1] Delivered two days
before his departure for the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago,
Mozoomdar's speech is ridden with hopes and fears no doubt heightened by
what he felt to be a call from God to fulfill the prophecy of global
religious unity pronounced by his late friend and mentor Keshub Chunder
Sen.[^2] Before the danger of a long sea journey, PCM worried aloud over
his frail health, ability to glorify God, and the loneliness of his wife
Saudamini, who would stay behind in Kolkata. He sought from his
listeners both prayers for his wellbeing and the cessation of their
sectarian quarrels. Saddened by the past decade of conflict within the
Brahmo Samaj, PCM called for peace among its factions, the inner strife
of which threatened any chance for the united theistic brotherhood he
hoped would result from the World's Parliament of Religions. As will be
seen, these concerns followed Mozoomdar throughout his westward journey.
