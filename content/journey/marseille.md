Arriving on the evening of 8 August, Mozoomdar spent two days
sightseeing in the French town of Marseille. He described to Saudamini
the mountain ranges, backwaters, and the "very pretty, clean, and
cheerful" residents, who lack "the chalky whiteness that we find in the
Englishmen."[^29] In contrast to the pallor of his shipmates, PCM had
long since written to his wife of the healthful "red tinge" that the sea
journey had left on his body.[^30] Although his letters indicate that he
felt strengthened by the time spent in Marseille, Mozoomdar decided
against inland travel through Europe to London for health
reasons.[^31] Instead, he boarded the SS Khedive once again and set out
toward the Strait of Gibraltar.

    health and beauty is a refreshing inversion of contemporary
    "fairness" campaigns in the cosmetics industry.
