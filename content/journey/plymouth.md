Mozoomdar arrived in Plymouth on the morning of 16 August. His spirits
were high. With "a strange smell in the air that reminds one of
antiquity," PCM expressed to his wife how close he felt to God and his
mission: "It is almost as if He is standing in front of me, the great
Sage."[^36]Â The following day, he would sail across the Southern coast
and dock in Tilsbury, London.

[^36]: Mozoomdar, *Letters*, 35.
