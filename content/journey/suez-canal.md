At the height of his suffering Mozoomdar scribbled, "it's too hot to
write any more. I will just close my eyes for some time."[^23] By the
end of his five days on the Red Sea, PCM was covered in heat rashes and
found it difficult to breathe.[^24] In the delirium of his condition,
Mozoomdar mistook Port Suez for Port Said and posted letters to
Saudamini that he later apologized would likely arrive a full week later
than planned. Fortunately, the worst of his journey was over.
Immediately upon entering the Mediterranean, PCM wrote to his wife of
relief: "All storms have subsided. All the heat is gone, too. All fears
have been erased from my mind. The peaceful waters of Europe are making
the wind cool and pleasant."[^25]
