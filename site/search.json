A prominent member of the Brahmo Samaj, a Bengal-based community of Hindu reformers, Mozoomdar first captured the imagination of Europeans and Americans in 1883. At that time, his lectures across America\u0026rsquo;s eastern seaboard (not to mention the publication of his book, The Oriental Christ) enamored liberal Christians such as Jenkin Lloyd Jones, a Unitarian minister who would help organize the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions to be held in conjuction with the World\u0026rsquo;s Fair in Chicago.1 PCM attended and addressed this parliament in order to rally support for the New Dispensation, a Brahmo Samaj vision of global religious confraternity that he hoped would mark the end of religious sectarianism and restore the prominence of an emotional, rather than intellectual, pursuit of God. Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s narrative has often been refracted in order to account for Indian religious responses to British colonialism. Even then, his legacy is generally lost under the long shadow of Swami Vivekananda. Either way, PCM has rarely been the subject of his own story. By attending to Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s private life in the months that prefaced his addresses at the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions, based on letters he wrote to his wife Saudamini, \u0026rdquo;Mozoomdar at Sea\u0026rdquo; enables a fuller appreciation of these Chicago lectures, his religious mission, and his hope for the New Dispensation.\n Sunrit Mullick, The First Hindu Mission to America: The Pioneering Visits of Protap Chunder Mozoomdar (New Delhi: Northern Book Centre, 2010), 95.\r↩   ","id":2,"length":288,"title":"Introduction","type":"page","url":"/journey/intro/"},{"content":"Protap Chunder Mozoomdar gave a farewell address to his Brahmo Samaj congregation on Sunday evening, July 9, 1893.1 Delivered two days before his departure for the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions in Chicago, Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s speech is ridden with hopes and fears no doubt heightened by what he felt to be a call from God to fulfill the prophecy of global religious unity pronounced by his late friend and mentor Keshub Chunder Sen.2 Before the danger of a long sea journey, PCM worried aloud over his frail health, ability to glorify God, and the loneliness of his wife Saudamini, who would stay behind in Kolkata. He sought from his listeners both prayers for his wellbeing and the cessation of their sectarian quarrels. Saddened by the past decade of conflict within the Brahmo Samaj, PCM called for peace among its factions, the inner strife of which threatened any chance for the united theistic brotherhood he hoped would result from the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions. As will be seen, these concerns followed Mozoomdar throughout his westward journey.\n \u0026ldquo;Rev. PC.

In a letter to Saudamini, he complains that the SS Khedive had traveled only a few miles from the jetty before halting for 20 hours in the Garden Reach shipyard, affording no sleep due to the heat.2 This was followed by a full day\u0026rsquo;s delay at Diamond Harbor, the port at the mouth of the Hooghly River.

The letters he wrote to Saudamini during this time reveal a man enraptured by the beauty of the sea, which he took to be proof of God\u0026rsquo;s immanent presence. Consider his first impressions of the waters before him:\n The endless expanse of rippling blue is like the open arms of a mother. The dancing, churning waves crowned with surf are like excited children, and I their brother whose sight has filled them with joy, encouraging me to dance, chanting the name of Goddess Anandamayi.1\n Yet Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s prose never strays too far from matters of health, and the account of his first days at sea is ridden with descriptions of medications and reflections on his constitution. Although expressed as assurances to Saudamini of his healthiness, Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s preoccupation with details such as whether he slept through the night, the pain in his hand, his regular consumption of cod liver oil, and his upset stomach suggests that he continued to worry over his physical condition.2\n Ibid, 3.\r↩ Hunyadi János was a Hungarian aperient spring water that gained\rpopularity in the 1860s.

First, that the mark of God is manifest in all of the beauty and power of nature. Second, that despite abundant signs of divine presence, many have lost touch with the spirit of God.2\nPCM stopped for two days in Colombo, welcomed with generosity by Anagarika Dharmapala, the famous Buddhist revivalist who would also speak at the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions. In a letter to Saudamini, Mozoomdar extolled the monk\u0026rsquo;s kindness for allowing him to board in his father\u0026rsquo;s house, feeding him a feast of fresh fruits and vegetables, and attending to his insomnia by providing good conversation throughout the night.3\n Mozoomdar, Letters, 9.\r↩ Mozoomdar would later spell out these sentiments before the\rWorld\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions in his lecture titled \u0026ldquo;The World\u0026rsquo;s\rReligious Debt to Asia.\u0026rdquo; See Mozoomdar, Lectures in America,\r15-29.\r↩ Mozoomdar, Letters, 11-12.\r↩   ","id":6,"length":274,"title":"Colombo","type":"page","url":"/journey/colombo/"},{"content":"Mozoomdar returned alone to the SS Khedive, for Dharmapala had other travel arrangements. Over the next week-and-a-half amid the throes of the Arabian Sea, he wrote to his wife nearly every day. Though several of Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s letters express longing for Saudamini\u0026rsquo;s voice and cooking, his sharpest desire appears to have been to micromanage her life, even from afar. Figure 4. \rSaudamini Mozoomdar, c.1890.\rPublic domain image\r\r\r\rIn a telling sequence, he backtracks from the sentiment that his journey might allow Saudamini some rest from her wifely duties by proceeding to barrage her with rhetorical questions to the effect that she constantly apply herself toward sacred conduct.1 In another passage, his very desire to hear from her, far from the heartfelt pleas found in Indian love stories, becomes another attempt to control her lifestyle: he writes, \u0026ldquo;news of your happiness, your wellbeing, your following the Brahma-vrata2 like I did, you getting along with everyone around you will help my work profoundly.\u0026rdquo;3 The intimacy among these letters is, predictably for this period, that of a husband who assumes the right to control his wife\u0026rsquo;s affairs.4\nYet his letters during this period tell of more than a husband at pains to assert power over his wife. Mozoomdar often wrote of cloudless days of sultry heat and stormy nights that rattled the ship and its passengers. Though he insisted he never felt seasick and declared that the ocean voyage made him stronger, PCM complained of poor health during this stretch of travel: the heat kept him from sleep, the wind and the dampness made him feel ill, and he could not shake the pain from one of his hands.5\nThese rapid transformations in the weather did more than affect his health. On his third day out from Colombo, Mozoomdar wrote to Saudamini of black waves tearing into the hull of the SS Khedive in the manner of cannonballs and sheets of rain that transformed nature itself into the terrifying form of the goddess Bhairavi.6 Inspired by the tempest, Mozoomdar wrote an article for The Interpreter, a Kolkata-based journal he edited. Figure 5. \rThe goddess Bhairavi, c.1880s. Despite her calm demenaor and abhaya mudra, or \u0026lsquo;gesture to ward off fear,\u0026rsquo; Bhairavi is often a fear-inspiring goddess, as befits her name. Note her garland of skulls.\rPublic domain image, by P.C. Biswas\r\r\r\rThe refrain in this piece, titled \u0026ldquo;The Raging Sea,\u0026rdquo; as well as in his letters to Saudamini at this time, is to seek refuge in God, for \u0026ldquo;the unerring of the great Captain shall steer us to the harbor duly.\u0026rdquo;7 More than fear of domestic powerlessness, Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s consistent calls for trust in God\u0026rsquo;s will to both Saudamini and the readers of *The Interpreter* suggest a desire to maintain social ties with loved ones in the way he knew best - by preaching God\u0026rsquo;s presence. As will be shown, Mozoomdar felt more and more lonely *en route* to London.\n Ibid, 12-13.\r↩ In the context of the passage, this vrata or vow likely refers\rto maintaining a lifestyle of overall austerity for the benefit of\rnot only the vow-taker (in this case, Saudamini), but also her\rhusband.

After receiving and reading his first batch of reply mail from the port city, Mozoomdar gushes over the chance to read his wife\u0026rsquo;s writing:\n Only you can write this way.

For the past decade, he had been struggling to reconcile the warring Brahmo Samaj factions in the wake of Keshub Chunder Sen\u0026rsquo;s controversies and death, with little success. Bereft of his friend and alienated from other Brahmos because of that friendship, PCM became the object of scorn by many Brahmos who felt threatened by the idea that he might try to succeed Keshub as leader of the group.1 For Mozoomdar, whose global aspirations for the Brahmo Samaj and its New Dispensation were more pronounced than most, the opportunity to leave such squabbles behind in order to bring Keshub\u0026rsquo;s vision to life in the West was surely a welcome one.\nYet Mozoomdar expressed disappointment in the behavior of his shipmates. In a piece he wrote for The Interpreter, titled \u0026ldquo;Red Sea, Why Red,\u0026rdquo; PCM suggests that the Red Sea is so-named because of the excruciating heat experienced when traveling its waters. With tongue in cheek, he writes that even \u0026ldquo;the freezing attitude of his fellow passengers\u0026rdquo; cannot cool him down.2 Though there is no evidence that anyone treated him poorly at sea (to the contrary, he describes being pampered by a British servant named Harris, who massaged him with medicinal oils),3 PCM expressed to Saudamini that religious life aboard the ship did not meet his expectations. After several Sundays without the promised religious services, Mozoomdar resigned himself to dissatisfaction, writing \u0026ldquo;it turns out that neither Kolkata nor this ship can afford me those luxuries.\u0026rdquo;4 Without friends or occasions for religious fulfillment, and sweltering in the sun besides, Mozoodmdar was not at his best upon the Red Sea.\n Suresh Chunder Bose, The Life of Protap Chunder Mozoomdar\r(Calcutta: Nababhidan Trust, 1927), 114-5.\r↩ Mozoomdar, \u0026ldquo;Red Sea, Why Red,\u0026rdquo; The Interpreter 2, no.1, (1893):\r27.\r↩ Mozoomdar, Letters, 21.\r↩ Ibid, 16.\r↩   ","id":9,"length":306,"title":"The Red Sea","type":"page","url":"/journey/red-sea/"},{"content":"\rFigure 7. \rOn the Suez Canal, 1894.\rPublic domain image, by William Henry Jackson\r\r\r\rAt the height of his suffering Mozoomdar scribbled, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s too hot to write any more. I will just close my eyes for some time.\u0026rdquo;1 By the end of his five days on the Red Sea, PCM was covered in heat rashes and found it difficult to breathe.2 In the delirium of his condition, Mozoomdar mistook Port Suez for Port Said and posted letters to Saudamini that he later apologized would likely arrive a full week later than planned. Fortunately, the worst of his journey was over. Immediately upon entering the Mediterranean, PCM wrote to his wife of relief: \u0026ldquo;All storms have subsided. All the heat is gone, too.

In a letter written to Saudamini, he laments the difficulty of maintaining upright behavior amid the \u0026ldquo;luxury and sport and decadence\u0026rdquo; of those aboard the ship.2 Yet wariness of the passengers did not detract from Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s respect for the crew.

He reported good health, feeling refreshed by the sea air and free from seasickness, and mentioned a much warmer reception by these shipmates than he felt aboard the SS Khedive.3 Mozoomdar gave two lectures in the RMS Umbria\u0026rsquo;s galleries, each attracting hundreds of listeners who applauded him to the point of embarrassment.4 On 2 September, Mozoomdar greeted the shores of New York.\n Mozoomdar, \u0026ldquo;On the Way to Chicago,\u0026rdquo; The Interpreter 2, no.3\r(1893): 50.\r↩ Ibid.\r↩ Mozoomdar, Letters, 41-42.\r↩ Mozoomdar, \u0026ldquo;On the Way to Chicago,\u0026rdquo; The Interpreter 2, no.3\r(1893): 51\r↩   ","id":18,"length":235,"title":"The Atlantic Ocean","type":"page","url":"/journey/atlantic/"},{"content":"If the applause of his listeners aboard the RMS Umbria humbled Mozoomdar, the sight of the New York harbor once again inspired him to eloquence.

Although cheerful upon his arrival, convinced that everything he saw at the World\u0026rsquo;s Fair was graced with God\u0026rsquo;s presence, PCM soon became disheartened by lack of news from Saudamini. In the first of several letters written to her in Chicago, he attempts to console himself by insisting that despite his longing to see his wife, she \u0026ldquo;wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to tolerate the journey\u0026rdquo; and therefore rightly remained in Kolkata.1 Yet his despondence worsened as the beginning of the parliament approached. On the evening of September 10, hours before the conference would begin, he wrote:\n I feel lonely and tired. I wondered why I haven\u0026rsquo;t received your letters yet. Then I saw your handwriting. I feel numb and absent-minded. Write to me. Write anything. Whatever you write will be good for me. It will calm my mind, and also be good for you.

I await your hopeful voice in this foreign land. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to make yourself known.2\n It was not until over a week later that the longed-for letter arrived, postmarked 9 August. Preoccupied with the proceedings of the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions, PCM\u0026rsquo;s response indicates that he was impatient with his wife\u0026rsquo;s brevity, feeling too busy himself to write everything down.3 He also had doubts about his ability to keep in touch with her during the remaining three months of his stay in the US. These doubts appear to have been well-founded, for the final letter in the series ends mid-sentence: \u0026ldquo;I should have addressed all my letters via Spears, because I don\u0026rsquo;t know how they will be delivered if I change my address.

Though Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s health was poor, nothing\rindicates that he stopped writing during his remaining time in the\rUS. Unfortunately, no records of Saudamini\u0026rsquo;s letters to PCM exist.\r↩   ","id":21,"length":429,"title":"The World's Parliament of Religions","type":"page","url":"/journey/chicago/"},{"content":"No records remain of Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s correspondence with Saudamini after his departure from Chicago. One reason for this, and also perhaps for his feeling \u0026ldquo;numb and absent-minded,\u0026rdquo; is that Mozoomdar\u0026rsquo;s health declined rapidly during the course of his three-week stay there. By the close of the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions, PCM was diagnosed with diabetes and forbidden to work. Yet his sense of duty to his divine task both forbade him from heeding his doctor\u0026rsquo;s advice and prevented him from writing home about his condition.1\nMozoomdar surely felt pressure to perform well at the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions, not only to justify his travel to the West, but also to validate his hopes that the New Dispensation could flourish there. It is to his credit that little of PCM\u0026rsquo;s personal problems surface among his speeches in Chicago.2 Accounts of his addresses depict Mozoomdar at his best. For example, the Christian Register, a Boston paper edited by John Henry Barrows, the chief organizer of the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament of Religions, proclaimed:\n No voice commanded more attention or more sympathy at the Parliament of Religions than that of the prophet of the Brahmo-Somaj. Upon no one in the Pentecostal gathering did the cloven tongue of fire more surely rest [than on] Mr. Mozoomdar.3\n Further evidence rests in the transcriptions of his speeches, though it is beyond the scope of this exhibition to detail these parliament lectures. Rather, this chronicle has been meant to provide the intimate and seldom-considered details of PCM\u0026rsquo;s hopes, fears, and experiences during his sojourn from Kolkata to Chicago. Mozoomdar was eager to travel yet homesick, publicly ebullient yet privately ill, anxious of failure yet inspired by God. This personal context, much more than the history of British colonialism or even the controversies of Keshub Sen, holds the key to understanding most fully his addresses in Chicago and his broader religious vision.\n Bose, Life of Protap, 185.\r↩ This is not to say that his failing health was lost to his\rfriends.

In total, he was said to have delivered almost 200 lectures during his three months in the country in 1893.1 His efforts bore fruit. Immediately after the World\u0026rsquo;s Parliament, John Henry Barrows began an effort to provide PCM financial support. In December 1893, this resulted in the Mozoomdar Mission Fund, which allowed PCM to visit the US once more in 1900.2 In October 1894, Caroline E. Haskell gave \\$20,000 to the University of Chicago in order to establish an annual lectureship in Kolkata. She did so as a direct response to a wish that Mozoomdar had penned to Barrows earlier that year.3\nThese and other developments kept PCM active until the summer of 1904, when his health began to decline sharply. Though his diabetes was under control, he had contracted tuberculosis, and his deteriorating condition confined him to his bed by December.4 Despite this, PCM spent the final six months of his life in earnest devotion: his friend and biographer Suresh Chunder Bose described it as \u0026ldquo;the conquest of the love of God over sickness and death.\u0026rdquo;5 Mozoomdar died in his Kolkata home on May 21, 1905, in the company of Saudamini and under the watchful gaze of Debendranath Tagore and Keshub Sen, whose portraits hung on the wall nearby.6 Though he cannot be said to have fully realized his ambitions for the Brahmo Samaj, Mozoomdar died at peace, in the company of loved ones, ready for union with the divine. Perhaps the two epitaphs inscribed on his monument, written in his own words, express this best:\n I have done the work that was given to me, I have kept the vow I took. I have struggled to unfold my message to many men and women. Peace fills my soul. For all opportunities and facilities, yea for discouragements and depressions, I have the heart to be grateful to God. His ways are not our ways, nor His purposes our purposes.

Initial artistic changes at that time in France were executed by Italian and Flemish artists, such as Jean Clouet and his son François Clouet, along with the Italians, Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco Primaticcio, and Niccolò dell\u0026rsquo;Abbate of what is often called the first School of Fontainebleau from 1531. Leonardo da Vinci also was invited to France by François I, but other than the paintings which he brought with him, he produced little for the French king.

It is characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful that rely upon visual rhetoric, including the elaborate use of allegory and mythology.

No longer conceived of as fortresses, such pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill.\nBaroque and Classicism The seventeenth century marked a golden age for French art in all fields. In the early part of the seventeenth century, late mannerist and early Baroque tendencies continued to flourish in the court of Marie de Medici and Louis XIII. Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe, namely the Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the Counter-Reformation. Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of Peter Paul Rubens with his the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to Nicolas Poussin with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicism. Another proponent of classicism working in Rome was Claude Gellée, known as Le Lorrain, who defined the form of classical landscape.\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure\r\rThe supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file.

The later is credited with bringing the baroque in France and at his return in Paris in 1627 he was named first painter of the king. But French painting soon departed from the extravagance and naturalism of the Italian baroque and painters like Eustache Le Sueur and Laurent de La Hyre, following Poussin example developed a classicist way known as \u0026ldquo;Parisian atticism\u0026rdquo;, inspired by Antiquity, and focusing on proportion, harmony and the importance of drawing. Even Vouet, after his return from Italy, changed his manner to a more measured but still highly decorative and elegant style.\nBut at the same time there was still a strong Caravaggisti school represented in the period by the amazing candle-lit paintings of Georges de La Tour. The wretched and the poor were featured in a quasi-Dutch manner in the paintings by the three Le Nain brothers. In the paintings of Philippe de Champaigne there are both propagandistic portraits of Louis XIII\u0026rsquo; s minister Cardinal Richelieu and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Catholic Jansenist sect. In architecture, architects like Salomon de Brosse, François Mansart and Jacques Lemercier helped define the French form of the baroque, developing the formula of the urban hôtel particulier that was to influence all of Europe and strongly departed from the Italian equivalent, the palazzo. Many aristocratic castles were rebuilt in the new classic- baroque style, some of the most famous being Maisons and Cheverny, characterized by high roofs \u0026ldquo;à la française\u0026rdquo; and a form that retained the medieval model of the castle adorned with prominent towers.\nFrom the mid to late seventeenth century, French art is more often referred to by the term \u0026ldquo;Classicism\u0026rdquo; which implies an adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque, as it was practiced in southern and eastern Europe during the same period. Under Louis XIV, the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy, was not in French taste, for instance, as Bernini\u0026rsquo;s famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.

The Palace of Versailles, initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for fêtes and parties, under the direction of architects Louis Le Vau (who had also built the château de Vaux-le-Vicomte) and Jules Hardouin Mansart (who built the church of the Invalides in Paris), painter and designer Charles Le Brun, and the landscape architect André Le Nôtre who perfected the rational form of the French garden that from Versailles spread in all of Europe.\nFor sculpture Louis XIV\u0026rsquo;s reign also proved an important moment thanks to the King\u0026rsquo;s protection of artists like Pierre Puget, François Girardon and Charles-Antoine Coysevox. In Rome, Pierre Legros, working in a more baroque manner, was one of the most influential sculptors of the end of the century.\nRococo and Neoclassicism Rococo and Neoclassicism are terms used to describe the visual and plastic arts and architecture in Europe from the late seventeenth to the late eighteenth centuries. In France, the death ofLouis XIV in 1715 lead to a period of freedom commonly called the Régence. Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722, the young king Louis XV and the government led by the duke of Orléans residing in Paris. There a new style emerged in the decorative arts, known as rocaille : the asymmetry and dynamism of the baroque was kept but renewed in a style that is less rhetoric and with less pompous effects, a deeper research of artificiality and use of motifs inspired by nature. This manner used to decorate rooms and furniture also existed in painting. Rocaillle painting turned toward lighters subjects, like the \u0026ldquo;fêtes galantes\u0026rdquo;, theater settings, pleasant mythological narratives and the female nude. Most of the times the moralizing sides of myths or history paintings are omitted and the accent is put on the decorative and pleasant aspect of the scenes depicted. Paintings from the period show an emphasis more on color than drawing, with apparent brush strokes and very colorful scenes. Important painters from this period include Antoine Watteau, considered the inventor of the fête galante, Nicolas Lancret and François Boucher.\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure\r\rThe supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file.

The Chantilly, Vincennes and then Sèvres manufactures produced some of the finest porcelain of the time. The highly skilled ébénistes, cabinet-makers mostly based in Paris, created elaborate pieces of furniture with precious wood and bronze ornaments that were to be highly praised and imitated in all of Europe. The most famous are Jean-François Oeben, who created the work desk of king Louis XV in Versailles, and Bernard II van Risamburgh. Rooms in châteaux and hôtels particuliers were more intimate than during the reign of Louis XIV and were decorated with rocaille style boiseries (carved wood panels covering the walls of a room) conceived by architects like Germain Boffrand or ornemanistes (designers of decorative objects) like Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier.\nThe most prominent architects of the first half of the century were, apart Boffrand, Robert de Cotte and Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who designed public squares like the place de la Concorde in Paris and the place de la Bourse in Bordeaux in a style consciously inspired by that of the era of Louis XIV. During the first half of the century, France replaced Italy as the artistic centre and main artistic influence in Europe and many French artists worked in other courts across the continent.\nThe latter half of the eighteenth century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the speaking the French language was expected for members of the European courts. The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, such as Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork. Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, genre painting, landscape, portrait, and still life were extremely fashionable. Chardin and Jean-Baptiste Oudrywere hailed for their still lives although this was officially considered the lowest of all genres in the hierarchy of painting subjects.\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure\r\rThe supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file.

Hubert Robert\u0026rsquo;s images of ruins, inspired by Italian cappricio paintings, are typical in this respect as well as the image of storms and moonlight marines by Claude Joseph Vernet. So too the change from the rational and geometricalFrench garden of André Le Nôtre to the English garden, which emphasized artificially wild and irrational nature. One also finds in some of these gardens—curious ruins of temples—called \u0026ldquo;follies\u0026rdquo;.\nThe middle of the eighteenth century saw a turn to Neoclassicism in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and iconography. This movement was promoted by intellectuals like Diderot, in reaction to the artificiality and the decorative essence of the rocaille style. In painting, the greatest representative of this style is Jacques-Louis David, who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile. His subject matter often involved classical history such as the death of Socrates and Brutus. The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by Nicolas Poussin in the seventeenth century. Poussin and David were in turn major influences on Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Other important neoclassical painters of the period are Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Joseph-Marie Vien. Neoclassicism also penetrated decorative arts and architecture.\nArchitects like Ledoux and Boullée developed a radical style of neoclassical architecture based on simple and pure geometrical forms with a research of simetry and harmony, elaborating visionary projects like the complex of the Saltworks of Arc-et-Senans by Ledoux, a model of an ideal factory developed from the rational concepts of the Enlightment thinkers.\n","id":44,"length":2276,"title":"An Introduction to French Art","type":"essay","url":"/french-art/"}]
